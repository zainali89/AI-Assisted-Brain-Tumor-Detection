# AI-Assisted-Brain-Tumor-Detection

Our Brain Tumor Classification project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify brain tumors from medical imaging data. Utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system analyzes MRI scans to detect the presence, type, and stage of brain tumors. The model is trained on a large dataset of annotated images, allowing it to recognize patterns and anomalies that indicate different tumor types. This automated classification aids medical professionals by providing quick and reliable diagnostic support, enhancing treatment planning and patient management. This project not only improves the accuracy of brain tumor diagnoses but also significantly speeds up the diagnostic process, contributing to better patient outcomes.
